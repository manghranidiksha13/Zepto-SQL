**Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project**
This project showcases real-world data analysis skills using SQL on a quick-commerce inventory dataset inspired by [Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/), one of India’s fastest-growing grocery delivery startups. It’s designed to simulate the workflow of a data analyst working with retail or e-commerce data — from database setup to actionable business insights.

## What This Project Covers

This hands-on project walks through:

- Setting up a relational **PostgreSQL database** from raw CSV  
- Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with SQL  
- Cleaning and transforming real-world messy data  
- Generating **business-oriented insights** using SQL queries  

##  Dataset Summary

The dataset mimics a product catalog with realistic challenges like duplicate products, varying weights, discounts, and mixed quantity formats. It was originally scraped from Zepto’s listings and is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/palvinder2006/zepto-inventory-dataset).
